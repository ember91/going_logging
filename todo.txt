Now:
Ensure errors are handled
Improve documentation
Forward declarations
Don't pollute namespace
Compile with all warnings enabled
Include everything used (but not more)
Run static analysis
Run valgrind
add noexcept, const, constepxr etc where applicable
No tabs
Test on Windows
Use std::move where applicable
Move goinglogging.h to include instead of include/goinglogging/
Add cpplint to CMake
Rename from goinglogging to going_logging

Future:
Better looking doxygen theme
Add colour
Add c++20 concepts
Add type information (int i: 7)
Add template specialization to put quotation marks around strings
Redirect all logging to a configurable stream. Make the disable functionality redirect it to no stream.
