Now:
Ensure errors are handled
Improve documentation
Add build instructions
Add instructions of required packages (CMake, doxygen, ...)
Add problem description (printf("i = %s\n"); vs l(i);)
Compile with all warnings enabled
Include everything used (but not more)
Run static analysis
Run valgrind
add noexcept, const, constepxr etc where applicable
No tabs
Test on Windows
Use std::move where applicable
Add cpplint to CMake

Future:
Add template specialization to put quotation marks around strings
Better looking doxygen theme
Add colour
Add c++20 concepts
Add type information (int i: 7)
Redirect all logging to a configurable stream. Make the disable functionality redirect it to no stream.
