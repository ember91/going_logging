Cleanup:
Improve documentation
Compile with all warnings enabled
Run static analysis
Run valgrind
add noexcept, const, constepxr, explicit etc where applicable
No tabs
Test on Windows
Clean up CMakeLists.txt
Forward declare all functions
Check limit of 80 characters
Ensure classes are PascalCase, variables camelCase and functions snake_case
Inline functions in classes?
Change name of of macros to GL_INTERNAL
Ensure one character c-strings use single quotes
Ensure almost no usage of std::cout
Ensure internal use objects have "\note For internal use."
Use ::gl::internal instead of gl::internal
Fix order of functions and classes
Pass std::string by reference only when necessary
Ensure documentation such as \param ends with dot
Don't convert between const char* and std::string too much
Don't use C-style comments
Ensure parameters are in a good order

Features:
Test type name prefix for multiple variables with l(). Add type name test.
Add specialized type name prefixes for all std classes and for some pointer types. Add tests for this.
GL_INTERNAL macros can use an intermediate macro to reduce code duplication
ninja instead of make
Add problem description (printf("i = %s\n"); vs l(i);)
Add support for types in std, such as std::vector
Take as parameter and return ostream from array and matrix
Run doxygen in cmake
Better looking doxygen theme
Add test of colored output
Add c++20 concepts?
Redirect all logging to a configurable stream. Make the disable functionality redirect it to no stream.
VS code settings
VS code clang format
github create a release
Add c++17 std::string_view to Stringify template specializations
